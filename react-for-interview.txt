features and advantages of react
    1. use of virutal dom to improve efficiency
    2. reusable components
    3. gentle learning curve
    4. huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from

virutal DOM
    virtual DOM is a concept where a virtual representation
    of the real DOM is kept inside the memory and is synced with the real DOM by a
    library such as ReactDOM.    
    whenever there is a change in state variable, react updates only that div or that DOM
    in which the state variable is present. example of datestring

    handling of state

props
    inputs to a component of React
state
    Every component in react has a built-in state object, which contains all the
    property values that belong to that component

controlled(state) vs uncontrolled components(refs)
    different approaches to handling
    input from elements in react.    
 
    In a controlled component, the value of the input
    element is controlled by React.

    In uncontrolled components the value of the input
    element is handled by the DOM itself.
    To access the value of the input element, we can use ref

hooks
    React Hooks are the built-in functions that permit developers for using the state 
    and lifecycle methods within React components. These are newly added features made
    available in React 16.8 version. Each lifecycle of a component is having 3 phases
    which include mount, unmount, and update.
    useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef
